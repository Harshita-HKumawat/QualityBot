## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack application with a React-based frontend and a FastAPI (Python) backend. It is designed for [briefly describe the project's purpose and functionality].

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

- `frontend/`: Contains all the React frontend code, including components, services, and build configurations.
- `backend/`: Contains the FastAPI backend application, including API endpoints, database models, and business logic.
- `config/`: Stores deployment scripts and environment templates.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
- `.env.example`: A template for environment variables required by the project.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- Python 3.9+
- pip (Python package installer)
- npm or Yarn (for frontend dependencies)

### Backend Setup

1.  Navigate into the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Create a Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
3.  Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
4.  Install the backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1.  Navigate into the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install the frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

## Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables for sensitive information and configuration. You need to create a `.env` file in the root of your project based on the `.env.example` template.

**Create `.env`:**

```bash
# In the root of your project, create .env and fill in your values
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual secrets:

```ini
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./backend/users.db" # Or your production database URL
SECRET_KEY="your-super-secret-key"
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET_KEY="your-super-secret-refresh-key"
VITE_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000" # Or your deployed backend URL
```

## Deployment

This project is set up for separate deployments:

### Frontend (Vercel)

The frontend is a React application and can be deployed to Vercel. Ensure your `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in Vercel's environment variables points to your deployed backend URL.

1.  Install Vercel CLI:
    ```bash
    npm install -g vercel
    ```
2.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
3.  Deploy to Vercel:
    ```bash
    vercel
    ```

### Backend (Railway)

The backend is a FastAPI application and can be deployed to Railway. Ensure your environment variables (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY`, `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET_KEY`) are configured in Railway.

1.  Install Railway CLI:
    ```bash
    npm i -g @railwaydev/cli
    ```
2.  Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
3.  Deploy to Railway:
    ```bash
    railway up
    ```

## Running the Project Locally

To run the project locally, you need to start both the backend and frontend separately.

1.  **Start Backend:**
    Navigate to the `backend` directory, activate its virtual environment, and run:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    .\venv\Scripts\activate # Windows
    # source venv/bin/activate # macOS/Linux
    uvicorn app:app --reload
    ```

    The backend will typically run on `http://localhost:8000`.

2.  **Start Frontend:**
    Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev # or yarn dev
    ```
    The frontend will typically run on `http://localhost:5173`.

## Testing

### Backend Tests

Navigate to the `backend` directory, activate its virtual environment, and run:

```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

### Frontend Tests

Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm test # or yarn test
```
